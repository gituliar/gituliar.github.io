This book is about screen writing -- a topic I decided to study more in depth in order
to improve my writing and composition skills. Not surprisingly, screenwriting
is mostly focused on entertainment industry. This might seem to be irrelevant for a technical
blogger. However, it offers valuable suggestions to structure and build narrative of the text.
Screenplays are much less formal and easy-to-read than regular books, which make them similar
to blog posts. As a screenplay is supposed to evolve into a movie, a blog post might
evolve into a YouTube video or GitHub project.

Screenwriting is also a craft being established for more than an century. Many talented writers
were attracted by its lucrative rewards and fame. For a newbie writer this craft offers a lot
to learn from: best practices, do's and don'ts, workflow suggestions, etc. It'd be unwise to
invent that knowledge yourself.

In this review, I focus mostly on the content related to technical blogging and try to avoid
entertainment details which this book is full of. Although, in the end you'll find a list of movies
mentioned in the book, which I believe are nice movies worth to watch.

This is not a classic book on screenwriting. In fact the author suggest it to be the last one
you'll ever need. At the time of writing, _Save the Cat!_ had 5'773 reviews on Amazon -- more
than any other screenwriting book. Hence, I decided to start my journey with it and follow
with classic recommendation from Blake afterwards.
