## Intro

**How to improve craft of writing a tech blog?**

> - Screenwriting tips/craft/wisdom for tech blogging

This book is about screen writing -- a topic I decided to study more in depth in order to improve my
writing and composition skills. Not surprisingly, screenwriting is mostly focused on entertainment
industry. This might seem to be irrelevant for a technical blogger. However, it offers valuable
suggestions to structure and build narrative of the text. Screenplays are much less formal and
easy-to-read than regular books, which make them similar to blog posts. As a screenplay is supposed
to evolve into a movie, a blog post might evolve into a YouTube video or GitHub project.

Screenwriting is also a craft being established for more than an century. Many talented and creative
writers were attracted by its lucrative rewards and worldwide fame it brings. For a newbie writer
this craft offers a lot to learn from: best practices, do's and don'ts, workflow suggestions, etc.
It'd be unwise to invent that knowledge yourself.

In this review, I focus mostly on the content related to technical blogging and try to avoid
entertainment details which this book is full of. Although, in the end you'll find a list of movies
mentioned in the book, which I believe are nice movies worth to watch.

This is not a classic book on screenwriting. In fact the author suggest it to be the last one you'll
ever need. At the time of writing, _Save the Cat!_ had 5'773 reviews on Amazon -- more than any
other screenwriting book. Hence, I decided to start my journey with it and follow with
less-modern-classic recommendation from Blake afterwards.

## You need a Logline -- Act 1

> - You need Idea and Logline
> - Think about Genre. Screen tech blogs, make like that, but different

You need a good idea, title, and a logline.

As you have a logline, decide which genre it is most like.

Genre: front-end, back-end, system, embedded, business. These can help to identify a story mechanics
of the idea you are working on. Keep a blogroll.

"What is it?" is obviously the first thing you should have some idea about. at least roughly.
Make your reader decide from title what you are writing about. Make intrigue, stimulate curiosity,
but make the main point clear for the reader. Pitch attention. Concentrate on writing one sentence,
one line.

Logline should hook attention, intrigue, stimulate interest. Provide synopsis of the plot and an
emotional (ironic or provocative) hook to stimulate interest.

## You need a Structure -- Act 2

> - Screenwriting is about emotions -- not a good fit for tech blogs
> - Make it out of 4 Acts
>   - Good for mental picture, as your acts may contain subacts
> - Logline for every act
>   - Help to build a solid structure to reason about in your head
> - Remember, writing is iterative process. First verion of everything is shit.

Strong structure is extremely important for a movie script with all its emotional swings, unexpected
turns, and other tricks that keep an audience engaged. That is not so much true for a short blog
post, especially of a technical nature.

Like with a logline for the whole post, you should prepare to describe every part of it in a couple
of sentences.

Writing a narrative is a top-down activity, like software design, but not like writing code, which
is a bottom-up activity. Like most creative processes it is also iterative, so be prepared for
multiple iteration of rewriting. Remember "The first draft of anything is shit".

Prepare for writing. Sketch story with 4 cards: set a theme, A/B stories, final word. On every card
something happens that causes the emotional tone to change drastically (+/- or -/+). Also it should
contain a conflict with explicit statement of who is who in the conflict. Conflicts get our
attention.

Use a blackboard to visualize your movie before start writing. Figure out the major turns first.
Enhance various parts of the story with color.

Every movie falls into a category, which has the rules you have to know. In order to put a fresh
spin on a tradition. What movie is yours similar to ? 10 genres. Do a homework on a genre. Screen
similar blogs, make it like that, but different. (What are your favorite blogs / posts ?)

## Summary -- The worst thing that could ever happen is to not finish.

> - This post follows a four-act structure
> - Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.

Even for this short post I sorted out a logline while reading the book. It changed few times as I
failed to predict remaining of the book while reading, however at the end I had a clear idea of what
I want to write about. Building a logline while reading a book is extremely helpful to understand
what author is trying to say and sort it out in your head for yourself.

# Book Notes

#### Book in 3 Sentences

#### Top 3 Quotes

- The worst thing that could ever happen in screenwriting is to not finish.
- Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.
- Movies are so much about what happens that we must learn about characters by what they do, not by
  what they say. In a good movie, information does not come out in diaglog, it comes out in what's
  _happening_ now. Show, don't tell!

Every movie is about someone, who we can focus on. It defines an auditory and complements a logline.
