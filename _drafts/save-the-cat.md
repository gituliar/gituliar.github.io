**How to improve your writing?**

This post is not about screenwriting. I am not a screenwriter either. It started one raining evening
in Copenhagen when I asked myself "How to improve my writing skills?". Tutorials on writing novels
probably don't exist, but even if they do, I wouldn't need them. Eventually, I want to focus is
blogging, but not lengthy fiction.

What is close to blogging by form? You guessed it -- screenwriting. A concise, minimalist form with
structured action line that hits right on target, without mumbling and clutter.

You can dedicate your life to screenwriting. It is a real profession. As every profession it should
have some best practices, rules to follow (or avoid), and practical advices how to overcome crisis
moments. This is what I decided to look for. The book I started with is "Save the Cat!" by Blake
Snyder. This is a modern classic. The author suggests it to be the last book you'll ever need,
that makes sense to some extend.

> - Mention McKee and 21 days...

## You Need a Logline

> - You need Idea and Logline
> - Think about Genre. Screen tech blogs, make like that, but different

You need a good idea, title, and a logline.

As you have a logline, decide which genre it is most like.

Genre: front-end, back-end, system, embedded, business. These can help to identify a story mechanics
of the idea you are working on. Keep a blogroll.

"What is it?" is obviously the first thing you should have some idea about. at least roughly.
Make your reader decide from title what you are writing about. Make intrigue, stimulate curiosity,
but make the main point clear for the reader. Pitch attention. Concentrate on writing one sentence,
one line.

Logline should hook attention, intrigue, stimulate interest. Provide synopsis of the plot and an
emotional (ironic or provocative) hook to stimulate interest.

## You need a Structure

> - Screenwriting is about emotions -- not a good fit for tech blogs
> - Make it out of 4 Acts
>   - Good for mental picture, as your acts may contain subacts
> - Logline for every act
>   - Help to build a solid structure to reason about in your head
> - Remember, writing is iterative process. First verion of everything is shit.

Strong structure is extremely important for a movie script with all its emotional swings, unexpected
turns, and other tricks that keep an audience engaged. That is not so much true for a short blog
post, especially of a technical nature.

Like with a logline for the whole post, you should prepare to describe every part of it in a couple
of sentences.

Writing a narrative is a top-down activity, like software design, but not like writing code, which
is a bottom-up activity. Like most creative processes it is also iterative, so be prepared for
multiple iteration of rewriting. Remember "The first draft of anything is shit".

Prepare for writing. Sketch story with 4 cards: set a theme, A/B stories, final word. On every card
something happens that causes the emotional tone to change drastically (+/- or -/+). Also it should
contain a conflict with explicit statement of who is who in the conflict. Conflicts get our
attention.

Use a blackboard to visualize your movie before start writing. Figure out the major turns first.
Enhance various parts of the story with color.

Every movie falls into a category, which has the rules you have to know. In order to put a fresh
spin on a tradition. What movie is yours similar to ? 10 genres. Do a homework on a genre. Screen
similar blogs, make it like that, but different. (What are your favorite blogs / posts ?)

## Summary -- The worst thing that could ever happen is to not finish.

> - This post follows a four-act structure
> - Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.

Even for this short post I sorted out a logline while reading the book. It changed few times as I
failed to predict remaining of the book while reading, however at the end I had a clear idea of what
I want to write about. Building a logline while reading a book is extremely helpful to understand
what author is trying to say and sort it out in your head for yourself.

# Book Notes

#### Book in 3 Sentences

#### Top 3 Quotes

- The worst thing that could ever happen in screenwriting is to not finish.
- Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.
- Movies are so much about what happens that we must learn about characters by what they do, not by
  what they say. In a good movie, information does not come out in diaglog, it comes out in what's
  _happening_ now. Show, don't tell!
