#### Book Choice

This book is about screen writing -- a topic I decided to study more in depth in order
to improve my writing and composition skills. Not surprisingly, screenwriting
is mostly focused on entertainment industry. This might seem to be irrelevant for a technical
blogger. However, it offers valuable suggestions to structure and build narrative of the text.
Screenplays are much less formal and easy-to-read than regular books, which make them similar
to blog posts. As a screenplay is supposed to evolve into a movie, a blog post might
evolve into a YouTube video or GitHub project.

In this review, I focus mostly on the content related to technical blog writing and try to avoid
entertainment details which this book is full of. Although, in the end you'll find a list of movies
mentioned in the book, which I believe are nice movies worth to watch.
