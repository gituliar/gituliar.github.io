- Do we need fast code ?
  - When you hear _fast code_, do you think elegant or ugly code?
  - We need fast code, but that should not be a priority. Most of the time we need usable and
    testable code. Similar to Lego blocks -- simple and small building blocks suitable for
    construction of complex systems.
  - Fast code should be in complicated blocks.

- _Options with Gender._
  - Introduce **geneder** for put/call options.
  - Derive âš¥, gender risk.
  - Add humor. Propose to issue Gender Options in line with a gender equality policy,
    along with European, American, Asian, Bermudian.
