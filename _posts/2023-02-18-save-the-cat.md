> The worst thing that could ever happen is not to finish.

This post is not about screenwriting. I am not a screenwriter either. It started one raining evening
in Copenhagen when I asked myself "How to improve my writing skills?". Tutorials on writing novels
probably don't exist, but even if they do, I wouldn't need them. Eventually, I want to focus on
blogging, but not lengthy fiction.

What is close to blogging by form? You guessed it -- screenwriting. A concise, minimalist form with
structured action line that hits right on target, without mumbling and clutter.

You can dedicate your life to screenwriting. It is a real profession. As every profession it offers
best practices, rules to follow (or avoid), and, in case of writing, how to overcome crisis moments.
This is what I decided to look for. A book I started with is "Save the Cat!" by Blake Snyder. This
is a modern classic. The author suggests this is the last book you'll ever need, while also
recomending classics such as "Story" by Robert McKee and "How to Write a Movie in 21 Days" by Viki
King.

## You Need a Logline

> A businessman falls in love with a hooker he hires to be his date for the weekend -- _Pretty Woman_

A logline is as important as a good idea or title. Make your readers decide from the title what
you are writing about. Make a logline to pitch their attention.

It should tell them _what it is_. All you need is one or two sentences that define theme of your
story. A logline should hook attention, intrigue, provide ironic or provocative hook to stimulate
interest. Remember, emotions is the key.

## You Need a Structure

> Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.

After a logline, decide on style or genre. Keep a blogroll -- a list of what you like. Identify
story mechanics and rules of reads that resonate with you. Analyze structure and form like you are
cracking magician's secrets.

Make like that, but different. With time you will develop your own style.

## You Need Persistence

> The first draft of anything is shit.

Finally, be prepared for multiple rewrites and edits. Remember that writing is an iterative process.
Reserve some time between edits to refresh your mind and change focus.

Don't rush. Take your time. Enjoy the process not the outcome!
