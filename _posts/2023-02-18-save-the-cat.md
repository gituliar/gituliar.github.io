> The worst thing that could ever happen is not to finish.

This post is not about screenwriting. I am not a screenwriter either. It started one raining evening
in Copenhagen when I asked myself "How to improve my writing skills?". Once again, I found myself at
the point where I felt to wrap my thoughts into a blog post, but had no idea where to start, as I
got lost in the ideas that were bombarding me from everywhere. Perhaps you also have found yourself
in a similar situation. I'd love to hear more in the comments.

What is close to blogging? You guessed it -- screenwriting. You can dedicate your life to
screenwriting. It is a real profession. Like any profession, it offers best practices, rules to
follow and avoid, and, what was important for me, how to approach writing as a professional. In
addition, it offers a clean, minimalistic form with a structured line of action that hits right on
target, without mumbling and clutter. Everything minimalistic always appeals to me.

This is where I decided to dig. The book I started with is "Save the Cat!" by Blake Snyder. This is
a modern classic. The author suggests this is the last book you'll ever need, but also recommends
classics such as "Story" by Robert McKee and "How to Write a Movie in 21 Days" by Viki King.
Excellent books that are already waiting for their turn on my desk.

## You Need a Logline

> A businessman falls in love with a hooker he hires to be his date for the weekend. -- _Pretty Woman_

A logline is as important as a good idea or title. Make your readers decide from the title what
you are writing about. Make a logline to pitch their attention.

It should tell them _what it is_. All you need is one or two sentences that define the theme of your
story. A logline should hook attention, intrigue, provide ironic or provocative hook to stimulate
interest. Remember, emotions is the key.

## You Need a Structure

> Screenwriting is like solving a puzzle -- the more stories you break, the better you get.

After a logline, decide on style or genre. Keep a blogroll -- a list of blogs that resonate with
you. Identify their mechanics and storytelling rules. Analyze structure and form as if you were
cracking magician's secrets.

Write like that, but different. With time you will develop your own style.

## You Need Persistence

> The first draft of anything is shit.

Finally, be prepared for a lot of rewrites and edits. Remember that writing is an iterative process.
Reserve some time between edits to clear your mind and refocus.

Don't rush. Take your time. Enjoy the process, not the result!
