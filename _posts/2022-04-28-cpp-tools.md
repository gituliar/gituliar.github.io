Not many people associate words "handy", "neat", or "sweet" with C++. I am one of those who does.

C++ programming is for everyone and it is fun. Most C++ books however dive directly into the
language, without paying much attention to the development environment. This leaves a novice
programmer with extra effort to choose "right" tools, compatible with each other, to form a solid
development toolset.

In this post let me share a toolset that works for me and makes my C++ experience great.

To make the narrative more complete, let me say a few words about Linux.  For many years during my
research in physic, Linux was my primary environment. It is fascinating to have hundreds of powerful
utils waiting behind the terminal window to solve any task.  Losing that Linux-terminal sort of
power was a nightmare for me and therefore migration to another OS not an option. Unless, there
appeared [Windows Subsystem for Windows][wsl]{:target="_blank"} (WSL). It brings a whole Linux world
into Windows. The integration is so great, that Windows + WSL replaced Linux on my laptop. Pure
Linux is what I keep using on servers.

This is a short story why I demand my C++ projects to compile natively on Linux and Windows. (Next
on my demand list is x64 and ARM64 compatibility. I have not experiment with this yet due to lack of
decent ARM64 hardware.)




## 1. Terminal

[Windows Terminal][wterm]{:target="_blank"} is a modern terminal for Windows.

If browser is the most used application on my PC, then terminal takes a solid 2nd place.  Install it
from App Store and enjoy in tandem with WSL!

## 2. Development

<img class="section-open" src="/img/posts/vs2022.svg"/>

[Microsoft Visual Studio][vs2022]{:target="_blank"} is the most advanced IDE for C++ development.
 
No other IDE offers so rich set of tools mutually integrated with each other and operation system.
It is extremely well integrated with Linux (WSL) and its tools, so that we can compile and debug
native Linux applictions from Windows.  All this thanks to engeeniers from Miscrosoft, which invest
huge effort to integrate both worlds. Very impressive and noticable in VS2022.

  - Compiler
  - Debugger / Profiler
  - Linux integration (WSL)
  - Build system (CMake for Linux / Windows)


## 3. Build system

<img class="section-open" src="/img/posts/cmake.png"/>

[CMake][cmake]{:target="_blank"} is defacto a standard build system for C++.

It runs on Windows, Linux, and many other systems. It is a part of VS installation on Windows.


## 4. External Libraries

<img class="section-open" src="/img/posts/vcpkg.png"/>

[vcpkg][vcpkg]{:target="_blank"} is an open-source package manager for C++ from Microsoft.

The best way to use popular C++ libraries in your project. It is integrated with CMake and works on
Linux / Windows.

It is very easy install and use:

  * __Install vcpkg__

    ```
     $ cd %USERPROFILE%/Sources
     $ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
     $ ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```

  * __Install Packages__

    Now we can install packages and use them within `CMakeLists.txt` in our project.

    Two libraries I link at the very beginning are
      - __docopt__ for neat command-line interface
      - __spdlog__ for handy logging

    ^

    ```
    $ vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows-static docopt spdlog
    ```

    I prefer static linking as final executable is not bind with local files. This allows to copy our
    program to any machine without worrying to install dependencies there.

  * __Update vcpkg__

    Do not forget to update vcpkg from time to time as new packages or updates may become available.

    ```
    $ cd %USERPROFILE%/Sources/vcpkg
    $ git pull
    ```
