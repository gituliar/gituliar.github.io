In this post you will find details about my programmins setup. As C++ is my primary language,
the narrative will be biased towards this technology.

You should already know that C++ offers enormous development possibilities. It's used in
embedded systems, databases, games, web browsers, and business applications, to name a few.
In the __financial modeling__, which is my professional field, usually you won't find any special
requirements for hardware or development environments. Except perhaps math libraries,
optimized for a specific CPU architecture (usually x64), when pricing of exotic derivatives or
using machine learning is required.

Hence, when it comes to C++ toolset, my main focus is on convenience of development,
deployment, and troubleshooting as covered below.

First of all, I want to run my programs on Windows and Linux. (Windows is my primary system ...
Linux I use in the cloud to run web services.)  At the same time, I want to minimize
amount of my time to support such cross-platform compatibility, so that my C++ codebase feels
transparent and development process is based on the same IDE, the same build system, the same
package manager on both platforms.

[Windows Subsystem for Windows][wsl]{:target="_blank"} (WSL) brings a whole Linux world
into Windows. The integration is so great, that Windows + WSL replaced Linux on my laptop. Pure
Linux is what I keep using on servers.

[Microsoft Visual Studio][vs2022]{:target="_blank"} is probably the most advanced IDE for C++ development.
Unfortunately for Linux developers, it runs on Windows only. This does not mean, however, that it's not
suitable for developing Linux applications.

Since Aug'22, Visual Studio 2022 allows to <u>build</u> and <u>debug</u> native C++ binaries under
Linux, which is possible thanks to a tight integration with WSL. This is a killer feature!
 
Debugging happens with native Linux tools, like GDB, with no emulation or other hacks. All debug
info is available: call stack, local variables, threads, etc. Since I use Ubuntu in production,
this feature allows me to investigate and fix production issues without switching from my regular
Visual Studio environment.

I believe that every modern programming language ought to offer a package manager in its ecosystem. 
C++ has no standard solution for this, however [vcpkg][vcpkg]{:target="_blank"} provides
everything I needed so far.

It's open-source, maintained by Microsoft on GitHub, integrated with CMake, and works on Linux and Windows.


<img class="section-open" src="/img/posts/cmake.png"/>

[CMake][cmake]{:target="_blank"} is a build system for cross-platform Visual Studio projects. It is
also a build system for vcpkg (not a big surprise since both are maintained by Microsoft).

For me it feels transparent, yet powerful to onboard new libraries on Linux and Windows. It's a part of
Visual Studio installation on Windows and easily installed on Ubuntu with a standard method.


<img class="section-open" src="/img/posts/terminal.png"/>

I am a heavy user of Linux command-line tools. Hence, the terminal is where I spend most of my time,
except for the web browser and code editor.

[Windows Terminal][wterm]{:target="_blank"} is a modern terminal for Windows with a lot of cool features.
My requirements for it, however, are rather low: Unicode and UTF-8 support, multiple tabs, copy/paste from
clipboard, compatibility with Linux utils, and perhaps clickable URLs (after all, it's 2022).


## Summary

In 2022 my C++ toolset looks as following:

  * [WSL2][wsl]{:target="_blank"} + [Ubuntu][ubuntu]{:target="_blank"}
  * [Visual Studio 2022][vs2022]{:target="_blank"}
  * [vcpkg][vcpkg]{:target="_blank"}
  * [CMake][cmake]{:target="_blank"}
  * [Windows Terminal][wterm]{:target="_blank"}

This works with minimum friction on Windows -- my development platform, and Linux -- my production platform in the cloud.
